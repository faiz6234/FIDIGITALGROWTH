    <h2>Our Creative Process</h2>
    <p>Most college consulting firms don't realize that <strong>every piece of writing is advertising for their services.</strong> If readers aren't engaged by your content, they won't trust you to help them present themselves to colleges.</p>
    <p>When one of your services itself is essay writing help, every single word that you release needs to be curated by someone who understands your industry. We've worked with multiple international consulting firms and I myself am attending UCLA. That being said, we've identified two issues that almost all college consultants face.</p>
    <h3>We identified two key problems:</h3>
    <div class="problems">
      <div class="problem-box">
        <strong>Problem #1</strong><br>
        Educational content that creates worry without connecting to actual services
      </div>
      <div class="problem-box">
        <strong>Problem #2</strong><br>
        One-to-one funnels that don't scale for high-ticket consulting
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="solution">
    <h2>Our Solution</h2>
    <p>We build a brand and story around one core insight that differentiates your consulting from others. For one client, it was that being a jack of all trades doesn't work. Colleges want specialists who go deep into genuine interests, not achievement stackers.</p>
    <p>That exact idea and email campaign achieved <strong>over 70% open rates</strong> because it changed a belief that many parents hold: <em>"that my child HAS to be the best at everything."</em> That simply isn't true. This campaign <strong>booked 15 calls</strong>.</p>
